* A simple way for them to generate accounts and app IDs in the staging environment.  We need to allow them to set up an account to support TLS for example, so they could sign up using the free sign up process, and then we'll need to think about how we provide them with a simple admin area to modify the account settings.
* Sample HTML app where they can plug in their App ID.  Perhaps just a simple JSBin for now, later we could have a dedicated page using our code editor.  Obviously this would be best done using our debug console, but this is not ready yet.
* Documentation on staging and production environment end points
* Documentation on how to include Thrift protocol support for their language
* Documentation on the REST API, allowing HTTP if a token is used
* Documentation on the authentication, and how to use token based auth or basic auth.  How to issue token requests, respond to auth requests etc.  Simple ways to handle these requests.
* Links to existing library code relating to specific features
* Feature list - now and in the future
 * point to point messaging
 * custom CNAME/domain set up
 * presence
 * support for WebSockets only for now, but we must consider that later we may support fall back to other HTTP protocols if users report connectivity issues.
 * message and event history
 * short cut methods
 * Encryption
