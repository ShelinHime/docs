Ably provides "REST client libraries for a range of languages":/rest/client-libaries including "Java":https://ably.io/download/rest-client-libraries#java, "Python":https://ably.io/download/rest-client-libraries#python, "Ruby":https://ably.io/download/rest-client-libraries#ruby, ".NET":https://ably.io/download/rest-client-libraries#dotnet, "Node.js":https://ably.io/download/rest-client-libraries#nodejs, "iOS":https://ably.io/download/rest-client-libraries#iOS and "many more...":https://ably.io/download/rest-client-libraries.

Whilst you are free to use our REST API directly, we advocate the use of the client libraries as they strictly follow our REST API specification, they have good test coverage, they provide a layer of convenience and simplicity for developers, and they provide a number of additional features such as network failure re-routing and encryption.

In addition, we have ensured that our client libraries adhere to a consistent API across all languages.

The documentation for the client libraries is broken down as follows:

* "Usage":usage
* "Channels and publishing messages":channels
* "History and stats":history
* "Authentication":authentication

h2. REST Specification

The Ably REST API can be accessed over HTTP without the use of a client library.
